## <h1 align="center"> My C Journey<h1>


<p align="center">A comprehensive documentation of learning computer science fundamentals through Harvard's CS50x!</p>

# <div> 
During my gap year in Bangladesh, I embarked on an educational journey that would fundamentally reshape my understanding of computer science. Armed with nothing more than a modest laptop and an unreliable internet connection, I discovered Harvard's CS50x course. This decision marked the beginning of an intensive exploration into the world of programming, algorithms, and computational thinking. 
<br>
<br>
The journey began without fanfare or sophisticated equipment. There were no state-of-the-art development environments or high-speed internet connections. Instead, there was simply an unwavering curiosity and determination to understand how computers process information and execute instructions. What started as casual exploration evolved into a systematic study of computer science fundamentals, with C programming serving as the cornerstone of this educational foundation.

Week 0: Foundations in Computational Thinking
<h4 align="center">>-Scratch Programming Environment</h4>
</h2>
The first week was all about computational thinking, and we used Scratch, MIT’s visual programming language, to get started. Professor David Malan’s teaching style was super helpful—instead of worrying about complicated syntax right away, we learned core programming concepts through block-based coding. It made things way less intimidating!

Working with Scratch really helped connect abstract ideas (like loops, conditionals, variables, and functions) to actual implementation, since you could just drag and drop blocks to see how things worked. One of the projects I built was a simple but fun interactive jumping game—it was basic but taught me a lot about game mechanics and logic.

Week 1 was a full-on shift—from dragging blocks in visual programming to typing out real code in C. Yeah, I had touched C before back in senior high, but this was different. Professor Malan’s teaching style? Game-changer. He broke down complex stuff like memory management and pointers in a way that actually clicked. It wasn’t just “how to code,” it was “why this code works best,” and that mindset shift hit me hard.

<br>
I wasn’t just watching lectures—I was living them. Practicing side-by-side on VS Code and CS50.dev, scribbling notes like mad, asking ChatGPT whenever I hit a wall (which was often, lol). I wasn’t in it just to “finish the course”—I wanted to understand. And I did. I broke down every topic: variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, strings, pointers, memory… the works.
<br>
<br>
Here’s the truth: I’m not saying I’m a C expert (yet). But honestly? Something bigger happened—I fell in love with programming. For the first time, I wasn’t just finishing assignments. I understood what I was building. And that understanding? It changed everything.

  Throughout Week 1, I documented every key concept in my own words—literally. I kept detailed handwritten notes for each topic, from variables and loops to pointers and memory management.
